# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BTCNYC Classes! To keep our codebase clean and our reviews efficient, please follow these guidelines.

## PR Rules

### 1. Keep PRs Small
PRs must be **< 500 lines changed** unless pre-approved by a maintainer. Smaller PRs are easier to review, less likely to introduce bugs, and get merged faster.

### 2. PRs Must Do ONE Thing
Each PR should focus on a single concern:
- ✅ Copy/content changes
- ✅ Layout changes
- ✅ Refactoring
- ❌ Copy changes + layout changes + refactoring (split this into separate PRs)

### 3. Large Changes Require an Issue First
Before submitting a PR, open an Issue for:
- Large file moves or reorganization
- New folders or directory structure changes
- New pages or major new content

This allows for discussion and alignment before work begins.

### 4. Screenshots Required for UI Changes
All PRs that affect the visual appearance of the site must include screenshots showing:
- Before (if modifying existing UI)
- After

### 5. AI-Generated PRs Must Include the Prompt
If you used AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to generate code or content, include the prompt(s) used in your PR description. This helps reviewers understand the intent and verify the output.

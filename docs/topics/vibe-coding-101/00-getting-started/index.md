## 🧩 Overview

Vibe coding is a new approach that has emerged in the past year, allowing anyone to create software without any technical experience — simply by prompting AI.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to build and deploy a real website using only your web browser and natural language prompts. No software installation required. No coding experience needed. No payment or subscription necessary.

By the end of the 2-hour session, you'll have a live website on the internet that you created entirely through AI-assisted vibe coding.

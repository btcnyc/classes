## 🧩 Overview

Join us for a **hands-on class** on how to run your own Bitcoin node. A Bitcoin node connects your wallet directly to the Bitcoin network, allowing you to verify your own transactions, strengthen the network, and choose which consensus rules to follow.

By the end of the class, you'll understand:

* What a Bitcoin node is and how it works
* Why running your own node matters for sovereignty and privacy
* How to set up, configure, and use your own node hardware

> 💡 **Bring your own hardware and an 8GB+ flash drive** to get the most out of this class!

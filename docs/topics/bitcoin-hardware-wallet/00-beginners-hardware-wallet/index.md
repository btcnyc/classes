## 🧩 Overview
Hands-on workshop where students design, assemble, and provision a beginner-friendly Bitcoin hardware wallet from commodity parts.

Commercial devices can run **$90–$200**; this session shows how to get the same security benefits with inexpensive hardware you control end-to-end.

We'll show you how to source affordable components, load the open-source **Jade SDK** firmware, and practice secure wallet operations end-to-end. This class is **beginner friendly**—if you can follow step-by-step instructions, you can build a wallet.

You'll leave with the confidence to:

- Understand how hardware wallets secure your Bitcoin.
- Spin up additional devices cheaply to split savings across multiple wallets.
- Practice seed generation, backup, and recovery until it feels natural.
